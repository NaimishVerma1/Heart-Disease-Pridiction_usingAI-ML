# Heart-Disease-Pridiction_usingAI-ML
Heart disease is one of the killer diseases in the world.  Early detection of the disease is one of the ways to salvage  affected people. The use of machine learning techniques can be  used to offer solution to the detection of heart diseases. In this  study the accuracy of prediction of some tools of machine  learning has been carried out. The performance evaluation of the  three models have been carried out using precision, recall, F1- score and accuracy. The results obtained showed that Logistic  regession model out performed others in terms of precision,  recall, F1-score and accuracy
